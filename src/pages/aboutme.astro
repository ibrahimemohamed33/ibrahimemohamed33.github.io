      I enjoy solving complex problems that reveal the deep, inner workings of the universe, 
      especially when doing the impossible like assessing human behavior and the forces underlying our decisions.

        Before coming back to the D.C. area, I was a student at the University of Chicago, where I majored in math and took a wide variety of classes in computer science. I realized throughout college that I enjoyed solving problems outside the scope of pure math and inside the scope of applied CS. I also came to understand that producers, ranging from your local shop to big corporations, can only benefit consumers if they leverage the right data to make the right insights. I gravitated toward data-driven roles and found data engineering to have unique problems that required wearing many interesting hats.

        My switch from math to computer science also stems from my three internships at Microsoft Whiteboard, where I worked on enhancing the product's canvas and backend integration with Microsoft Teams. I was responsible for leveraging complicated affine transformations to develop a proper outline of the board's geometry feature, which further exposed me to the full-stack mindset when solving problems in software engineering. I also developed a feature to significantly simplify the workflow for Whiteboard users that came from Teams.

        My interests do not stop at STEM, however, and often expand into topics in philosophy; public transit; constitutional law; history of all sorts; business management; and political theory. When I'm not at work, you'll see me playing basketball, reading anything I can get my hands on, learning languages, listening to Arabic music, writing, or volunteering.
